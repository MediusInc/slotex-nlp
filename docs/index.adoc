SloTex project is designed as microservice-based project, which tries to
facilitate and make robust handling of incoming data with Redis server, and
stores processed data in MongoDB. We developed a front-end application for
handling data and training process
https://github.com/MediusInc/slotex-nlp-web[SloTex NLP web] project, and the
back-end application https://github.com/MediusInc/slotex-nlp-core[SloTex NLP
core] with exposed RESTFul web services developed with Spring Boot framework. 

For testing purposes we also developed a Bash client
https://github.com/MediusInc/slotex-nlp-pwc[SloTex NLP pwc] , which allows us
to send multiple documents in `.txt` or `.doc` format to the Redis queue and
allows us to initialize the training process and also other test scenario's. 

== Project goals
High-tech companies nowadays use language technologies in business
environments. Language technologies are embedded in applications that enable
the processing of large amount of data.  Today, there are many open source
frameworks on the market that enable the use of language technologies for many
languages.  Since Slovene has a relatively small number of speakers and
consequently lower market relevance, it is often neglected.

Our goal is to transfer know-how for application development, which includes
several open-source frameworks of language technologies, and the adaptation of
these technologies for the Slovene language.

World-famous open source software tools and frameworks will be used in our
project, with the goal to develop an application for Slovene intended for both
linguists as well as anyone else who is interested in information extraction
from a written text.  The application for business applications developed in
this project will enable users to use advanced neutral language modeling in
Slovene and English within open source frameworks that enable machine learning
of models in Slovenian texts for the purposes of:

* language detection,
* sentence recognition,
* morphological tagging,
* lemmatization,
* syntax parser and
* named entity recognition.

=== Named entity recognition

Our priority and the first task was to develop a named entity recognition tool
that could be used for commercial purposes.  Named entity recognition (NER)
also known as entity identification or entity extraction is a subtask of
information extraction that locates and classifies named entities from texts.
Currently, there are many defined catogories of named entites, such as person
names, organizations, locations.  In our project, we used Apache openNLP, a
machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language.  It
supports most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation,
part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.

== Named entity recognition for Slovene - problems and challenges
Slovene is intentionally rich language, meaning that the form of names changes
is every case. Since there are six cases in Slovene (nominative, genitive,
dative, accusative, locative and instrumental), each named entity can appear in
at least six forms.

This can be seen in the following example. According to the Statistical Office
of the Republic of Slovenia, the most common name in Slovenia in the year 2018
was Franc.

So, let's take "Franc", the most common masculine name, to show how this named
entity changes in all the cases.

Nominative = Franc

Genitive = Franca

Dative = Francu

Accusative = Franca

Locative = Francu

Instrumental = Francem

As you can see, the form of the entity is in almost all cases different. This
is what makes NER for Slovene a bit harder, since other languages, such as
English or German, do not know inflectional forms of names.  However, these are
not the only inflectional forms of the name Franc.  There are also six forms in
dual and 6 other forms in plural.  Altogether, there are 18 inflectional forms
of a single named entity in Slovene language.

All forms of the name Franc can be seen in the following table.

.Inflections in Slovene
|===
|Case|Singular|Dual|Plural
|Nominative|Franc|Franca|Franci
|Genitive|Franca|Francev|Francev
|Dative|Francu|Francema|Francem
|Accusative|Franca|Franca|France
|Locative|Francu|Francih|Francih
|Instrumental|Francem|Francema|Franci
|===


So one of the core problems of NER tool development was to learn the tool to recognize
also inflectional forms of names as named entities.

== External knowledge resources

Named entity recognition should be trained on corpus or on a large text
database. For that purposes we built a corpora, data for which were taken from
the website link:http://lit.ijs.si/leposl.html[Slovene literature online].
Here you can find collected Slovene literature works online. You can search and
read works, written by famous Slovene writers and poets, such as
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Vodnik[Valentin Vodnik],
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Pre%C5%A1eren[France Prešeren],
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Levstik[Fran Levstik] and many others.
Our corpora contains 109.193‬ sentences and approximately 1,200,000 words.

[red]#Normalization#

The second step was text normalization. This is a process that converts a list
of words to a more uniform sequence.  This step is very useful for later text
processing and for easier and quicker searching process.

First, we extracted all abbreviations, such as "itd." (ect) and npr. (e.g.).
All together, we defined 995 abbreviations that needed to be extracted. The
list of all abbreviations can be found on
link:https://github.com/aljaz-trebusak/ApacheOpenNLP-SloTex/tree/master/Documents/resources[GitHub].

[red]#Part-of-speech tagging#

POS tagging or part-of-speech tagging is the process of describing a word in a
text with its word class and other attributes.  Our project uses the
specifications of the project MULTEXT-East which account for 1902 different
tags and are available both in Slovene and in English.  The tags or
morphosyntactic descriptions are composed of 5-7 characters, each representing
a different attribute.  For example: "Janez" is a noun, proper, masculine,
singular and in nominative case. Its tag is NPMSN.  "Janezov" is an adjective,
possessive, of a positive degree, masculine, singular and in nominative case.
Its tag is ASPMSN.

.POS tag for Janez
|===
 |category|noun|N
 |type|proper|P
 |gender|masculine|M
 |number|singular|S
 |case|nominative|N
|===

POS tagging for Slovene is difficult due to many different tags. Slovene has
1902 different tags while English has less than a 100. Another difficulty are
different forms of words which are tagged differently often appear the same.
For example: "Marije" could be the nominative case plural of "Marija" or dative
case plural or it could be the genitive case singular. It could thus be
represented by each of these tags: NPFPN, NPFPD or NPFSG.  This problem can be
solved using the probability of each tag occurring, but with as many tags as
Slovene has, that strategy is not accurate enough. The context of the word
becomes more important in determining the correct tag.  In our project we used
POS tagging to facilitate named entity recognition. Focusing on names, the
large majority fall within a few categories, so we can limit our search to just
those categories. We can roughly disregard anything that is not a proper noun
(tags beginning with NP) or a possessive adjective (tags beginning with AS).

[red]#Levenshtein distance#

In order to improve our model, we applied the method based on Levenshtein
distance.  Levenshtein's Edit Distance algorithm is frequently used to
calculate the edit distance between any two strings in the same language. In
our project, we used it to measure the distance between lemmas of named
entities and their non-lemma forms. Under non-lemma forms of Slovene named
entities, we understand nouns and possessive adjectives that are inflected.
Meaning, the Levenshtein distance is actually the number of single-character
edits between the words, in our case between lemmas and inflectional forms. As
a single-character edit we understand every insertion, deletion or substitution
that ist required to change the inflectional form into lemma or vice versa.
With Levenshtein distance, we trained our model to measeure if two entities
that are written in different cases are actually the same named entity.

For example, with Levenshtein distance, we trained our model to recognize the
entity "Markov" as the inflectional form of the name "Marko".

An examle that features the comparison of "Marko" and "Markov" can be seen in
the next table:

.Levenshtein distance example
|===
|||M|a|r|k|o|
||0|1|2|3|4|5|6
|M|1|0|1|2|3|4|5
|a|2|1|0|1|2|3|4
|r|3|2|1|0|1|2|3
|k|4|3|2|1|0|1|2
|o|5|4|3|2|1|0|1
|v|6|5|4|3|2|1|1

|===

Our model was trained to recognize two entities as the same word in different
cases if the distance between them was lower than 1. If the Levenshtein
distance is zero, it means that the strings are equal.


For the project we used database of Slovene names that we got on the website of

Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia].
